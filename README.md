==============

A suite of tools for collecting, recording, aggregating and graphing any sort of timeseries data.

Includes:

* A dynamic library for collecting stats from inside a running binary.
* A timeseries storage server supporting very high throughput additions and using as much storage as you like.
* A JavaScript? graphing library to display recorded timeseries.
* Tools to collect existing stats by SNMP and store them in the data store.
* An RPC library to create your own tools to read and write to the data store.

This is still in very early development, and not yet suitable for anybody who doesn't like code.
